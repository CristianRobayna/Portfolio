## Introduction

Hello!Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Cristian, and I’m thrilled to have you here!

In this repository, you will find projects and case studies that showcase my expertise in:

Data gathering and wrangling using tools like Python and R.

Statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

Data visualization and storytelling with tools like Tableau, Power BI

Spreadsheet proficiency with Excel and Google Sheets.

These projects reflect my passion for extracting actionable insights from data to solve complex business problems.

## About Me & My Data Journey

I first completed my Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A) at the Carlos III University of Madrid, where I cultivated a strong interest in finance and data analytics. Building on this foundation, I pursued a Master’s degree in Business Analytics from Universidad Europea, where I deepened my expertise in data science and analytical tools through practical coursework and projects.

My professional experience includes roles as a Data Analyst and Property Manager at Holiday Rural and as a Junior Data Analyst at Cash and Carry Lanzaroteño. In these roles, I optimized pricing strategies, automated operations, developed real-time dashboards, and reduced operational inefficiencies. These experiences sharpened my skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools while fostering a data-driven approach to problem-solving.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities in Switzerland to advance my career as a Data Analyst. I am eager to bring my skills to a forward-thinking organization where I can deliver actionable insights and contribute to strategic decision-making.

## Proj#1 - Predictive Analysis of Credit Risk Using Machine Learning Techniques

This project involves data analysis and processing of customer application data to predict the likelihood of loan default. The dataset contains various features about loan applicants, such as their income, loan amount, family status, and more. The goal is to prepare and clean the data for further analysis, machine learning models, or other relevant operations.
