# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Cristian, and I’m thrilled to have you here!

In this repository, you will find projects and case studies that showcase my expertise in:

- Data collection, cleaning, and transformation using tools like Python, Power Query, and R.

- Statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning.

- Data visualization and storytelling with tools like Tableau and Power BI.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Let’s get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey

I first completed my Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A) at the Carlos III University of Madrid, where I cultivated a strong interest in finance and data analytics. Building on this foundation, I pursued a Master’s degree in Business Analytics from Universidad Europea, where I deepened my expertise in data science and analytical tools through practical coursework and projects.

My professional experience includes roles as a Data Analyst and Property Manager at Holiday Rural and as a Junior Data Analyst at Cash and Carry Lanzaroteño. In these roles, I optimized pricing strategies, automated operations, developed real-time dashboards, and reduced operational inefficiencies. These experiences sharpened my skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools while fostering a data-driven approach to problem-solving.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities in Switzerland to advance my career as a Data Analyst. I am eager to bring my skills to a forward-thinking organization where I can deliver actionable insights and contribute to strategic decision-making.

## Projects

## Proj#1 - Predictive Analysis of Credit Risk Using Machine Learning Techniques

- **Objective**: To develop a predictive credit risk model using advanced machine learning techniques, with a focus on handling highly imbalanced datasets.

- **Approach**: Addressed the imbalance challenge using resampling techniques such as RandomUnderSampler and SMOTE, tested various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting methods, and fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance. Built an ensemble model using Bagging with LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest for improved accuracy and robustness.

- **Result**: Achieved an average accuracy of 68.02% and an AUC of 0.7414 across cross-validation folds, providing reliable discrimination between credit risk classes. The model’s adaptability and interpretability make it suitable for real-world banking applications.

- **Tools Used**: Python (Scikit-learn, LightGBM), Data Resampling Techniques, Ensemble Modeling.

# Proj#2 - Airbnb Price Analysis in Zurich

- **Objective**: To analyze Airbnb pricing trends in Zurich and identify factors influencing accommodation costs, focusing on location, property type, guest ratings, and availability.
  
- **Approach**: Integrated calendar, listing, and review datasets from Inside Airbnb using Power Query. Transformed raw data by handling missing values, converting price data to numeric format, and merging datasets. Conducted in-depth analysis using Power BI to explore district-level pricing, property type variations, proximity to landmarks, and bedroom distributions.
  
- **Result**: Identified significant pricing differences across Zurich's districts, with central areas like Kreis 1 commanding higher prices. Entire homes and serviced apartments were notably more expensive than private rooms. Zones near key landmarks such as Lake Zurich and Bahnhofstrasse showed premium pricing, while rating analysis highlighted the relationship between guest satisfaction and pricing trends.
  
- **Tools Used**: Power BI, Power Query, Inside Airbnb Data.
